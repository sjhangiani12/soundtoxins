The goal of SoundToxins is to provide sufficient
  warning of HAB and "Vibrio" events
  to enable early or selective harvesting of shellfish in Puget Sound.</p>

  In the Pacific
  Northwest there are several genera of algae and some bacteria that can cause
  harm when populations reach high enough numbers. During harmful algal blooms
  (HABs), the algal species and their toxins can accumulate in shellfish and
  can also be transferred up the food chain to humans. Disease outbreaks and
  closure of shellfish harvesting has also resulted from high concentrations
  of the bacterium <em>Vibrio
  parahaemolyticus</em> in oysters. In addition, high concentrations of some
  algal species can cause fish mortality. An outbreak of the toxic species of
  the diatom <em>Pseudo-nitzschia</em> led to the first closures of shellfish
  harvesting due to the toxin produced by the diatom in Puget Sound in 2003 and
  2005. Shellfish closures due to the toxin produced by the species of the dinoflagellate, <em>Alexandrium</em>,
  have occurred throughout Puget Sound since the 1950s. Closures due to the bacterium <em>Vibrio
  parahaemolyticus</em> first occurred in 1997-1998 and again in 2006 and 2007.
  Due to the apparent increase in these HAB and Vibrio occurrences during the
  last decade, the Partnership for Enhanced Monitoring and Emergency Response
  to HABs in Puget Sound (SoundToxins) was formed.</p>

<p><b>Program Goals</b><br />The goal of the SoundToxins program is to provide sufficient warning of HAB and "Vibrio" events to enable early or selective harvesting of shellfish and to enable fish farmers to reduce the detrimental effects of the HABs on fish, thereby minimizing risks to both human and fish health and reducing economic loss to Puget Sound fisheries. To best accomplish this goal, the program objectives are: 1) to determine which environmental conditions promote the onset and flourishing of HABs and increased concentrations of Vibrio parahaemolyticus; and 2) to determine which combination of environmental factors can be used for early warning of HABs and Vibrio parahaemolyticus in Puget Sound.</p>
